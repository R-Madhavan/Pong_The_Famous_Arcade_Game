## Features
- **Ball:** Moves around and bounces off the walls and paddles.
- **Paddles:** Control two paddles (left and right) using the keyboard.
- **Scoreboard:** Keeps track of the left and right players' scores.
- **Collision Detection:** Detects collisions between the ball and the paddles, walls, and when the ball goes out of bounds.

### How the Game Works
1. **Ball Movement:** The ball moves continuously, bouncing off the top and bottom walls. If it hits a paddle, it changes direction.
2. **Paddle Control:** Each paddle can move up and down to prevent the ball from passing.
3. **Scoring:** If a player misses the ball, the opponent scores a point.
